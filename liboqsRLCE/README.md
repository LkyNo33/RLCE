# liboqsRLCE
This is the revised RLCE codes that could be integrated to [libOQS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) project. This is based 
on [Jonathan Wagner](https://github.com/jwagrunner)'s libOQS with RLCE integration at: <https://github.com/jwagrunner/liboqs> (this version uses RLCE's implementation of AES/SHA/SHA2. Thus it is compatible with OpenSSL 3.0).
