# liboqsRLCE
This is the revised RLCE codes that could be integrated to [libOQS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) project. This is based 
on [Jonathan Wagner](https://github.com/jwagrunner)'s libOQS with RLCE integration at: <https://github.com/jwagrunner/liboqs> (this version uses RLCE's implementation of AES/SHA/SHA2. Thus it is compatible with OpenSSL 3.0). 
I also have a local copy at <https://github.com/yonggewang/liboqs> (this version uses Openssl 1.1.1's implementation of AES/SHA/SHA2. So it is not compatible with OpenSSL 3.0). The OpenSSL with libOQS/RLCE integrated could be found at <https://github.com/yonggewang/openssl>

# How to: 
follow the instructions at [integrate RLCE into libOQS](https://github.com/yonggewang/RLCE/blob/master/liboqsRLCE/RLCEinOpenSSL.pdf)
