# liboqsRLCE
This is the revised RLCE codes that could be integrated to [libOQS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) project. There are some integrations of RLCE into OpenSSL and LibOQL. The examples are: 
* Mugove T. Kangai's 2018 integrated libOQS (https://github.com/mutapa/liboqs) with details (https://github.com/yonggewang/RLCE/blob/master/liboqsRLCE/IntegrateRLCEOpenSSLversion1.0.2.pdf)
